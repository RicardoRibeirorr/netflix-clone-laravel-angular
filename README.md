## üíª About

Recreate the complete Netflix platform. Laravel as backend API and Angular as client frontend. Code to extract episodes from web pages (animefire.net) is also available in the "scrapper" folder. Note: I am not responsible for any illegality, this repository is only for testing skills.
All data from catalogs like title, description, cover, background photo and rating were extracted using the [API TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

### Funcionalities

- [x] **Authentication**: Login; Token, guards, middleware.

- [x] **Data Request**: Data return with lazy-loading, pagination with scroll and button. Includes: search, movies, series, latest, top, continue watching. "Favorites" is still in development.

- [x] **Player**: Includes all controls (i.e. back, pause, volume, +10sec, -10sec, next episode and fullscreen). Button of next episode and automatic episode passage after 6sec. Passage of episodes between seasons is included.

- [ ] **Dashboard**: Currently, all content will have to be added either through seeds or directly into the database.
